## Anti-AI Content Guidelines

To ensure our content feels authentic and human-written, avoid these common AI tells:

### 1. Tone & Voice

- **Avoid overly formal language** - Skip phrases like "In today's ever-evolving landscape" or "It is crucial to leverage innovative solutions"
- **Match the context** - Use casual tone for social media, conversational for blogs, professional for whitepapers
- **Inject personality** - Include opinions, preferences, and subjective viewpoints
- **Show emotion** - Express excitement, frustration, curiosity, or humor when appropriate

### 2. Writing Style & Structure

- **Vary sentence structure** - Mix short punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones
- **Use rhetorical questions** - Engage readers with "But what does this really mean?"
- **Include contractions** - Write "don't" instead of "do not", "we're" instead of "we are"
- **Natural transitions** - Connect ideas organically rather than using "Furthermore" or "Additionally" repeatedly

### 3. Content Depth & Authenticity

- **Share specific examples** - Use real scenarios, case studies, or personal anecdotes
- **Provide original analysis** - Don't just summarize; offer unique insights and conclusions
- **Include imperfections** - Acknowledge limitations, counterarguments, or areas of uncertainty
- **Show expertise** - Demonstrate deep understanding through nuanced explanations

### 4. Language & Grammar

- **Allow minor imperfections** - Occasional typos or colloquialisms make content feel human
- **Use industry-appropriate language** - Avoid buzzword overload like "transformative solutions in the realm of digital innovation"
- **Write conversationally** - Use "you" and "we" to create connection with readers
- **Include interruptions** - Use dashes, ellipses, or parenthetical asides naturally

### 5. Fact-Checking & Accuracy

- **Verify all statistics** - Never fabricate data or cite non-existent studies
- **Quote accurately** - When referencing sources, ensure exact attribution
- **Admit uncertainty** - Use phrases like "approximately" or "according to recent reports" when appropriate
- **Source everything** - Provide links and references for claims

### 6. Pacing & Variety

- **Vary paragraph lengths** - Mix short paragraphs with longer, detailed ones
- **Use lists strategically** - Break up text with bullets, numbers, or subheadings
- **Include dialogue** - Quote real people or create realistic conversations
- **Show process** - Explain how you arrived at conclusions or recommendations

### 7. Red Flag Phrases to Avoid

- "In today's ever-evolving landscape"
- "It is crucial to leverage"
- "This is important to note"
- "Furthermore, it is essential"
- "As an AI language model" (obviously)
- "Regenerate response"
- "Insert [anything] here"
- "Transformative solutions"
- "Cutting-edge innovation"
- "Seamless integration"

### 8. Quality Checks

Before publishing, ask:

- Does this sound like something a real person would say?
- Have I included personal opinions or subjective viewpoints?
- Are there specific examples rather than generic statements?
- Does the tone match the intended audience and platform?
- Have I varied sentence structure and paragraph length?
- Are all facts and statistics verified?

Remember: The goal is to create content that feels genuinely human - with personality, imperfections, and authentic insights that only a real person with expertise and experience could provide.
