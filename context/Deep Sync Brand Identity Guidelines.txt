Imagery & Photography
Imagery should be modern, high-quality, and invoke a sense of professionalism. Utilize imagery that has a strong focus on people over graphics, and avoid using photography that looks dated or from a stock collection.

Photography with strong, natural lighting and semi-blurred (high-focus) backgrounds or edges invoke a sense of modernism.
Modern & People-Focused
Rounded Edges on imagery as a standard layout display


The Deep Sync Graphics Library has available images.
Good!
Avoid

Note Line Breaks on the strokes on the middle spoke and on the cog wheel. 
9
Iconography
Icons should largely be linear, with medium sized stroke weights. Preferences towards icons with visual adornments, such as line breaks or motion-based elements.

Icons can be black, white on blue or blue. 
Linear and Modern
Good!
Avoid
Flaticon.com is a terrific resource for free icons that match our brand identity.

Imagery Layout & Element Overlays
In some cases, to invoke an enhanced “pop” to imagery, you can bring the subject outside of the bounding box/background. Here, you can see the subject’s head and arms float outside of the box.

You can also use the standard blue behind these types of images to create a strong contrast with the subject, the bounding box and the background. Additionally, floating rounded-edge boxes over more subdued backgrounds (like the simple green backdrop in this example), can add more flair and visual attention.

Logo Usage
These logos, whether Deep Sync or other subsidiary brands, should primarily be placed on white backgrounds. The transparency on the outside of the D icon as well as the line between “Deep” and “Sync” do not lend well to being on other colored backgrounds. 
Full Color Logos
Our logos are designed to be scaled down significantly, but in cases where pixel dimensions are below 128x128, defer to using the D icon logo instead of the full logo due to legibility. See this example on how these dimensions lend themselves better to the icon rather than the full logo. 
In applications in which the logo is to be placed on a colored background, default to our white logo option. This example utilizes our own branding, though the white logo works well on top of other color choices.
