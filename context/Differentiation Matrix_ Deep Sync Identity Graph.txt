“Deep Sync enables MNTN's customers to onboard 1p audiences accurately and at scale, and further enrich those with high quality 3p data for targeting."

	Deterministic matching methodology for highly accurate connections


(versus the use of probabilistic matching)




	Deterministic Matching - Online identifiers are connected deterministically, based on observed PII linkages for accuracy and stability; known profiles always resolve to real-world individuals and households
Connect offline and online IDs - We match to online and offline identifiers, including cookies, IPs, MAIDs, UID2s, hashed emails, and postal addresses without the use of modeling; digital linkages are refreshed monthly to ensure accurate, relevant connections


	Improve cross-channel campaign effectiveness - Activate and translate data across channels and platforms with accuracy with Deep Sync’s deterministic offline-to-online matching
Build stronger communication strategies - Leverage complete customer profiles to create more relevant messaging with personalization and segmentation
Connect with known customers online by activating your offline data
–
The primary benefits of deterministic matching are accuracy and precision; the primary challenge is lower scale. Deep Sync’s Addressability Multiplier can be implemented to help overcome certain issues around scale. Our individual- or household-level expansion capabilities create larger audiences while maintaining highly-accurate results. 
	On average, Deep Sync can identify 4 email addresses for each phone number received on input, and when an email address is received on input, we can generally identify 2 additional emails and 1 phone number
During a two-month trial period, a Deep Sync partner directly attributed $3.1 million dollars in ad spend on their platform to audiences that were expanded by Deep Sync’s identity graph
	Flexible and competitive commercials 


(versus other providers)
	Flexible and customized terms - As a privately-held company that sources and compiles our own data, we can offer more flexible commercial agreements than many other providers that are owned by large conglomerates or source their solutions from partner organizations
	Customized pricing - Experience customized pricing structures that are aligned to your specific goals or use cases
Simple and efficient buying - Eliminate complex packaged solutions that include products/services that are not relevant to your needs
	To maintain client confidentiality, we do not share client-specific pricing examples; however, we have been told on many occasions that our pricing structure and the level of flexibility we have related to graph solutions is superior to other providers
	Focused solutions with a  consultative, supportive approach


(versus industry heavy hitters attempting to sell a full data stack)


	Solutions targeted to needs - Deep Sync works closely with clients and prospects to achieve their specific  use cases; we won’t oversell beyond the identified need
Competitors try to sell large bundles - It’s a common practice for competitive providers to attempt to upsell measurement suites, servers, and more
